### Problems with v1.0 - 
1. Only small letter Alphabets are supported right now. No capital letters, digits or a special     characters
This is because nothing except capital letters, digits, and few special characters Zack has not provided his handwriting samples to us. So untill Zack releases his handwriting for other things, we are going to have small letters(that looks like Capital letters) only. 

2. Letter **O** is having some problems as it is of smaller size so it looks something like this :

Something similar hapenned with digits so I had to remove them. Here is a picture denoting the problem with numbers :

I guess this is because of the shape of the numbers and digits that are round. It is completely solve able but needs someone who is more experienced with the tools. If you think you are able to solve this issue, then go ahead to [this repository](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/ZackHandwriting) where you will find all the svg files for this project. Download it and help me in fixing the errors

### Version 1.5 -
I will be redoing everything by processing the png files to remove that extra thick boundary lines, once that is done, this font could be used in much smaller sizes too.

### Things to change in 2.0 -
1. Solve the previous problems
2. Add small letters, digits and special characters
