# JankySpiff
The .ttf file based on  font based on Zack Freedman's handwriting. 

Download the .ttf font from here by cloning it. And then add it to the software you want to use. *Sadly Google docs doesn't support custom .ttf font addition.* ***But you can add a custom font to MS WORD whome link is provided : *** [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1).

You have to research about the tool you want to use. Google will make the task very easy.

### Problems with v1.0 - 
1. Only small letter Alphabets are supported right now. No capital letters, digits or a special     characters
This is because nothing except capital letters, digits, and few special characters Zack has not provided his handwriting samples to us. So untill Zack releases his handwriting for other things, we are going to have small letters(that looks like Capital letters) only. 

2. Letter **O** is having some problems as it is of smaller size. So it looks something like this : 
	![Problem with O](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/JankySpiff/blob/main/imagesForReadme/problem2.png)

Something similar hapenned with digits so I had to remove them. Here is a picture denoting the problem with numbers :

3. Some characters looks weird due to the boundary lines surrounding them. For example the digit **5**
<br>![5](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/ZackHandwriting/blob/main/ZackFont/NumbersPNG/spiffy5.png)

This file would look normal but the svg format one,  I am not so sure about it - 
<br>![5 in svg](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/ZackHandwriting/blob/main/ZackFont/NumbersSVG/spiffy5.svg)
	
I guess this is because of the shape of the O and digits that are round. It is solveable but needs someone who is more experienced with the tools. If you think you are able to solve this issue, then go ahead to [this repository](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/ZackHandwriting) where you will find all the svg files for this project. Download it and help me in fixing the errors, or fix them yourself

### Version 1.5 -
I will be redoing everything after processing the png files to remove that extra thick boundary lines, once that is done, this font could be used in much smaller sizes too.

### Things to change in 2.0 -
1. Solve the previous problems
2. Add small letters, digits and special characters

**I wont be working on V1.5 and 2.0 for anytime soon. But my goal is to remove the issue of O asap.**
